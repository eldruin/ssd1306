//! SSD1306 OLED display driver
//!
//! The driver must be initialised by passing an I2C or SPI interface peripheral to the [`Builder`],
//! which will in turn create a driver instance in a particular mode. By default, the builder
//! returns a [`mode::RawMode`] instance which isn't very useful by itself. You can coerce the driver
//! into a more useful mode by calling `into()` and defining the type you want to coerce to. For
//! example, to initialise the display with an I2C interface and [mode::GraphicsMode], you would do
//! something like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let i2c = I2c::i2c1(/* snip */);
//!
//! let mut disp: GraphicsMode<_> = Builder::new().connect_i2c(i2c).into();
//! disp.init();
//!
//! // Display is now ready to draw to
//! ```
