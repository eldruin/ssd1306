# Changelog

[`ssd1306`](https://crates.io/crates/ssd1306) is a no-std driver written in Rust for the popular SSD1306 monochrome OLED display.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- [#97](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/97) Use the new `Triangle` primitive from Embedded Graphics 0.6.0-alpha.2 in the three SSD1306 `graphics*.rs` examples

## 0.3.0-alpha.2

### Fixed

- [#80](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/80) `TerminalMode` now has a cursor. Newlines (`\n`) and carriage returns (`\r`) are now supported.

### Changed

- [#94](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/94) Programs that only change some parts of the display should now run much faster. The driver keeps track of changed pixels and only sends a bounding box of updated pixels instead of updating the entire display every time.

## 0.3.0-alpha.1

### Changed

- **(breaking)** Upgraded to Embedded Graphics 0.6.0-alpha.2

## 0.2.6
